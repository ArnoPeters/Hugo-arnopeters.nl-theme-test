# Welcome to my blog!

I am Arno Peters, first and foremost a developer, but more and more a DevOps advocate and Agile enthusiast.  

Most of my spare time is spent tinkering with stuff. I am always fixing something, messing around with old pc hardware and working on my blog or side projects, but I also enjoy DIY-ing a lot. If time permits I also love to play games, on PC and sometimes console, although I am getting more and more nostalgic about my favorites ;) On the other hand, I believe VR is fantastic - if only there were more AAA experiences out there.  

I have been programming since a very early age. The main reason I thought it was time to start a blog, is because now that my career is progressing I find myself spending more and more time thinking about the workflows and processes surrounding software development.  

Besides that I love helping out with the purely technical side of things, I also enjoy the challenges of helping people, teams and organizations to create ways of working that are balanced, consistent and purposeful. Work without either a decent process or a process without regard for the people that do the work will lead to bad results either way. Agile is the buzzword of the day, but I am not fond of "ceremonies" or "rituals". A process should be an adaptable way of working to do whatever it is you need to do - consistently. For me, the whole purpose of any way of working is to ensure that people do the right thing at the right moment, and understand why it matters what they do.

With this blog, I intend to share what I'm working on, but more importantly - why I am working on it, and how I think it fits into the larger scope of things.
